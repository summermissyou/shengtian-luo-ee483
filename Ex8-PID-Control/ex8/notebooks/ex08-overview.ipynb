    "This topic gives you the error between current $\\theta$ angle and desired $\\theta_{desired}$ angle.\n",
    "- Implement a PID controller that uses the error value and calculates an $\\omega$ acceleration for the robot\n",
    "- Publishes the $\\omega$ acceleration to topic `control_input` with message type `Float32`\n",
    "3. A launch file **(named ex8.launch)** to start all nodes to run the exercise.\n",
    "- Start the `start_dynamics.launch` launch file from the `controls_aux` package provided\n",

    "### Problem description \n",
    "\n",
    "You will create your own node, and launch file to interact with a package provided in the class repo.  \n",
    "An MM starts with an initial $\\theta$ orientation $(0,0,\\theta_{initial} = 90^{\\circ})$.   \n",
    "Your goal is to control the angular velocity of the MM to drive the robot's orientation to a desired value, e.g., $0^{\\circ}$ degrees.  \n",
    "You will create a node that takes the error between current $\\theta$ and desired $\\theta_{desired}$ and calculates an angular velocity control input.  \n",
    "**Requirements for controller response:**\n",
    "- No more than $0.1$ radians of overshoot\n",
    "- Settling time of no more than 5 seconds, i.e., reaches close to 90% of $\\theta_{desired}$ in no more than 5 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "A ROS node has been provided that implement the dynamics of a differential robot like the MM robot (node *vehicle_dynamics.py* in the controls_aux pkg).  \n",
    "This node takes as input the values in the topic `control_input` and updates the robot position based on its dynamics.  \n",
    "In other words, it (1) takes angular velocity from topic `control_input`, (2) updates the position of the robot, (3) calculates the error $\\theta_{desired}-\\theta$, and (4) publishes the error in topic `error`.   \n",
    "Note that the error is measured in radians and not degrees.    \n",
    "Another node has been provided that takes in world $x, y, \\theta$ from the *vehicle_dynamics.py* and plots them.   \n",
    "Your node will fill the gap to compute the angular velocity control input using a PID controller and the error value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ROS Package\n",

    "Your control node will: \n",
    "- Import the Float32 message type beyond the your usual imports: ```from std_msgs.msg import Float32``` \n",
    "- Set a parameter `controller_ready` to true after initiliazing your node: `rospy.set_param(\"controller_ready\", 'true')`\n",
    "- Subscribe to topic `error` that is Float32 message.   \n",

    "### ROS Launch file\n",
    "Your launch file must start. \n",
    "A launch file `ex8.launch` has been created for you. \n",

    "You should not need to modify the `controls_aux` package.\n",
    "On the other hand, you will create your node and launch files inside the `pidcontrol` package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `controls_aux` package contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- vehicle_dynamics.py: A node simulating the MM dynamics additive measuments random noise. It receives the control input and outputs the error and position of the MM.  \n",
    "The MM starts in position $(0,0,1.57)$ and the desired $\\theta_{desired} = 0$.  \n",
    "After 15 seconds,  $\\theta_{desired}$ changes back to  $\\theta_{desired} = 0.8$ ($\\approx45^{\\circ}$).   \n",
    "NOTE: this node will start only when you set the parameter `controller_ready` to \"true\" (a string).  \n",
    "- controls_graph.py: A node plotting the position of the robot through time.    \n",
    "It subscribes to the topics published by the vehicle_dynamics.py node.    \n",

    "Right graph shows the position $(x,y)$ of the robot.  \n",
    "Note that the MM starts facing $90^{\\circ}$ then the controller makes the $MM$ to $0^{\\circ}$.  \n",
    "Next, the desired $\\theta$ values changes to $45^{\\circ}$ (around 15 seconds).  \n",
