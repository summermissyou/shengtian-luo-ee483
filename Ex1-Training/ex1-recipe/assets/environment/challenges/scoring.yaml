    - name: driven_lanedir_consec_median
      short: Traveled distance
      description: |
        This is the median distance traveled, *along a lane*.
        (That is, going in circles will not make this metric increase.)
        This is discretized to tiles.
      order: higher-is-better
      discretization: 0.62

    - name: survival_time_median
      short: Survival time
      description: |
        This is the median survival time. The simulation
        is terminated when the car goes outside of the road
        or it crashes with an obstacle or pedestrian.
      order: higher-is-better
      discretization: 2.0

    - name: deviation-center-line_median
      short: Lateral deviation
      description: |
        This is the median lateral deviation from the center line.
      order: lower-is-better
      discretization: 0.01

    - name: in-drivable-lane_median
      short: Major infractions
      description: |
        This is the median of the time spent outside of the drivable zones.
        For example this penalizes driving in the wrong lane.
      order: lower-is-better
      discretization: 0.2
